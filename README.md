# Football Data Analysis Project

## Abstract
The Game in Numbers: Analyzing Football Data from Transfermarkt. This project aims to unravel hidden patterns and trends within football data. It endeavors to uncover unique insights, presenting them vividly through visualization techniques. By bringing the numbers to life, the project aims to provide valuable insights into player statistics, team performance, and football analytics.

### Dataset

## Project Phases
### Data Preparation 📑
In this phase, we will gather, clean, and preprocess the data to ensure it's in a usable format for analysis. We will extract data from the Transfermarkt dataset, handle missing values, and prepare it for further exploration.

### Data Profiling 🔎
We will explore the dataset to gain an initial understanding of its contents. This will involve statistical summaries, data visualization, and identifying any patterns or trends in the data.

### Data Processing ⚙️
Once we have a good grasp of the dataset, we will perform data processing tasks such as feature engineering, aggregations, and transformations to create meaningful variables for analysis.

### Data Visualization 📈
This phase is where we bring the data to life through visualizations. We will create insightful plots, graphs, and interactive charts to communicate our findings effectively.

## Specific Aspects Explored
- Age distributions of football players
- Performance differentials at home and away in the top 5 leagues
- Player density in domestic competitions
- Player valuation trends over time
- Notable goal scorers against clubs from prominent players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi
- Player nationalities across leagues
- Analysis of goals based on their position on the field

This project aims to bridge the gap between data analytics and football, presenting engaging insights and fostering a deeper understanding of the sport through data-driven exploration.
